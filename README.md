# Wikipedia Viewer

A live version of this site can be found [here](http://codepen.io/toriancrane/full/yMYxpM/).

This custom Wikipedia viewer allows users to do the following:

1) Search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting entries.
2) Click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry (in this case the Wikipedia logo).

This app was made using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Wikipedia API.
